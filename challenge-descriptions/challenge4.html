Challenge Description

Identifying equipment in the field and correlating that to an asset number is important for writing work requests, performing maintenance work, performing safety lockouts and operation. Impacts from incorrect asset identification can range from a couple hours of time wasted to lost gold production to major injury when working on energized equipment thought to be isolated. This issue is evident in any mine site, production line, power plant or other business that has maintainable assets performing work. Typical solutions are physical signs or placards, but they are not always effective or long lasting in high vibration, dirty environments. They also do not lend themselves to a remote digital solution.

What kind of equipment will you need to identify and in what environment?

&nbsp;

User Story

Barrick’s maintenance and operations areas are beginning a transition to paperless digital solutions, and an iPad will become a standard tool. Users in the field should be able to positively identify assets in their proximity to ensure that work is being performed or prescribed properly. Identification of an asset is done through its asset number and an asset description. These assets range in size from a small pump or valve to 400-ton haul trucks. All manners of physical environments and weather are to be expected; indoor, outdoor, rain, snow, dirt, oil, -20F -&gt; 120F. Not all assets are physically accessible. Equipment in operation with rotating machinery is typically behind guarding and can prevent getting more than a couple feet away. Equipment can also be in elevated or recessed areas, such as exhaust fans or sump pumps.

This solution could be integrated into Barrick developed digital tools to promote safer, more efficient work across all of Barrick’s properties.
